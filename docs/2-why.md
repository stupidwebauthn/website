# But why Passkeys?

## Passwords are terrible

**Security Risks:**

- **Phishing Attacks**: Passwords are easily stolen through phishing attacks, where users are tricked into entering their credentials on fake websites.
- **Brute-Force Attacks**: Weak passwords can easily be cracked using automated tools that try multiple combinations.
- **Password Reuse**: Many users reuse the same password across multiple accounts, making them vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks.

**User Experience Issues:**

- **Complexity**: Creating and remembering complex passwords is a challenge for most users.
- **Password Resets**: Forgetting passwords leads to frequent resets, which is time-consuming and frustrating.

## The future is now

The time has come to move away from passwords and embrace more secure and user-friendly authentication methods like passkeys. Passkeys represent the future of authentication, offering a robust solution to the challenges posed by traditional passwords.

**Enhanced Security:**

- **Phishing-Resistant**: Passkeys are designed to be resistant to phishing attacks, as they rely on secure cryptographic keys rather than easily stolen passwords.
- **Strong Authentication**: Passkeys use public-key cryptography, providing a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords.

**Improved User Experience:**

- **Ease of Use**: With passkeys, users can authenticate using biometric methods like fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, making the login process faster and more convenient.
- **No More Password Resets**: Passkeys eliminate the need for password resets, reducing user frustration and support overhead.
